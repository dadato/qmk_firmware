/*
 * SK32F0xx drivers configuration.
 * The following settings override the default settings present in
 * the various device driver implementation headers.
 * Note that the settings for each driver only have effect if the whole
 * driver is enabled in halconf.h.
 *
 * The SK32F0xx family is register-compatible with STM32F072 except for the
 * USB IP (musbfsfc) and the peripheral set: the SK32F077 variant does not
 * have the TIM1, TIM2, SPI2 and I2C2 units (see the SK32_HAS_* macros in
 * sk32_registry.h).  The SK32 port provides native drivers for the core
 * platform (clocks, SysTick-based ST, ISR aggregation, GPIO/PAL, USB,
 * USART serial, SPI and I2C) and reuses the shared ChibiOS STM32 low level
 * drivers (TIMv1, ADCv1, ...) for the remaining peripherals.  This
 * mcuconf.h must therefore satisfy two naming schemes:
 *   - SK32F0xx_MCUCONF + the SK32_* clock/ST/peripheral settings (used by
 *     the SK32 native low level drivers), and
 *   - STM32F0xx_MCUCONF + the STM32_* settings consumed by the shared
 *     ChibiOS STM32 low level drivers.
 *
 * IRQ priorities:
 * 3...0       Lowest...Highest.
 *
 * DMA priorities:
 * 0...3        Lowest...Highest.
