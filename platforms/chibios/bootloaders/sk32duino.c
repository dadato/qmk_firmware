/*
 * sk32duino bootloader jump stub (SK32F077 / 3Think Cortex-M0).
 *
 * A custom flash bootloader ("sk32duino", VID:PID 1EAF:0003) lives at
 * 0x08000000 and owns the first 16 KB of flash.  The QMK application is
 * linked at 0x08004000.
 *
 * Cortex-M0 has no VTOR, so the bootloader remaps the application vector
 * table into SRAM (SYSCFG CFGR1 MEM_MODE) before jumping to the
 * application.  The first 512 bytes of SRAM (0x20000000..0x200001FF) are
 * therefore reserved and never used by the application.
 *
 * Entering DFU is a two step handshake:
 *   1. bootloader_jump() (QK_BOOT / bootmagic) stores a magic word at
 *      0x200001F0 and performs a system reset.
 *   2. The sk32duino bootloader runs first after the reset, sees the magic,
 *      clears it and stays in USB DFU mode.
 *
 * The magic address/value must match bootloaders/sk32duino/main.c.
